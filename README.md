Protected Mode
================

Processwire module to prevent access to front-end of website unless logged in.

Very handy during development/maintenance to allow the clients and testers to view the site, but keep everyone else out.

* Textarea field for message to be displayed to visitors
* Textarea field for message to be displayed to users who are not allowed
* Textarea for CSS to style the login form if you wish
* Various 503 settings
